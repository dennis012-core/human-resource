<br><br>
If you are signing up for the Service on behalf of a Client, you represent that you are duly authorised to represent the entity and accept the terms of this Agreement on behalf of such entity, and any references to “you” in this Agreement refer to such entity and all of its employees, consultants and agents.

<br><br>
Term and Termination
<br><br>
1.1 This Agreement will remain in effect until all subscriptions granted in accordance with this Agreement have expired or this Agreement is terminated by you or GEMS (the “Term”).

<br><br>
1.2 Subscriptions purchased by you commence on the start date specified upon payment and continue for the subscription term selected at the time of payment. Subscriptions automatically renew, as described in Section 4.1.

<br><br>
1.4 GEMS may terminate this Agreement at any time in the event you materially breach this Agreement and do not cure such breach within 30 days of written notice (including notice by email) provided by GEMS. However, in the case of your non-payment (including in the event when your credit card cannot be charged), we may suspend your access to the Service upon any such non-payment and may terminate this Agreement, if such breach is not remedied within 30 days of notice by GEMS to you. Further, we may immediately terminate your access to the Service without liability if it has a good faith belief that you are in violation of Sections 3.1, 3.5 or 11 of this Agreement.

For instances other than non-payment or violation under Section 3.1, in the event you cancel your account or this Agreement is terminated by GEMS or you, we will refund to you any prepaid fees covering any period of the term remaining after the date of termination for all subscriptions. However, no refund will be granted for the then-current month. Notice via email by GEMS to you will be sent to the email address you have provided to us.
<br><br>
1.5 In the event your account is terminated, other than in instances where it is terminated by GEMS for your non-payment or violation of Section 3.1, you will continue to have the ability to download the information provided, inputted or uploaded to the Service by you or on your behalf (“Data”) for 30 days after the effective date of expiration or termination. After such 30-day period or if your account is terminated due to your non-payment or violations of Section 3.1, we shall have no obligation to maintain any Data and shall thereafter, unless legally prohibited to do so, delete all of your Data contained in GEMS’s systems or otherwise in its possession or under its control.

<br><br>
eSignature Service
<br><br>
13.1 The “eSignature Service” is a service provided by GEMS for two counterparties (usually a company, herein described as the “sending party,” subscribing to GEMS’s services and an employee, employee-candidate or contractor) to electronically sign documents (including, but not limited to, agreements, policies, forms, etc.). If you use the eSignature Service office offered by GEMS, you acknowledge and agree to the statements set forth in this Section. Whenever you sign a document using GEMS’s eSignature Service you affirmatively consent to using electronic signatures via the eSignature Service and consent to conducting electronic business transactions. You also confirm that you are able to access the eSignature Service and the document you are signing electronically. When using the eSignature Service for a particular document, your consent applies only to the matter(s) covered by that particular document.
<br><br>
13.2 You are not required to use the eSignature Service or accept electronic documents provided thereby. If you are an employee, employee-candidate or contractor and you choose to not use the eSignature Service, you may still sign the document manually by notifying the sending party that you are choosing to do so and by obtaining a non-electronic copy of the document from them. GEMS assumes no responsibility for providing you with a non-electronic version of the document. In the event you are choosing to sign the document manually, do not use the eSignature Service to sign the document or to return the document to the sending party.
<br><br>
13.3 If you have signed a document electronically using the eSignature Service and transmitted it back to the sending party, GEMS will provide you the opportunity to download and print a paper copy of the document at no charge. If you later withdrawn your consent to using the eSignature Service, please notify the sending party and stop using the eSignature Service. Note that the decision to stop using the eSignature Service after you have already used it does not change the legality of the documents you have previously signed using an electronic signature.
<br><br>
13.4 When counterparties sign a document electronically using the eSignature Service, the rights and duties associated with that document are solely those of the counterparties. GEMS is not a party to the document and carries no liability or responsibility with respect to the correctness, validity or enforcement of the document; nor does GEMS have any liability or responsibility with respect to the legal or non-legal aspects of the document or any dispute arising as a result of the document. GEMS’s sole responsibility is the eSignature Service and customer service associated therewith.
<br><br>
13.5 PLEASE NOTE THAT GEMS’S STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN OR ELSEWHERE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OF ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS AND/OR THE SIGNATURE LINES OF DOCUMENTS THAT ARE ELECTRONICALLY SIGNED ARE FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; THEY ARE GENERAL IN NATURE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS LEGAL ADVICE. UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS GOVERNING ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES ON CERTAIN TYPES OF AGREEMENTS ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE. GEMS HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING THAT DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY SIGNED THROUGH GEMS’S ESIGNATURE SERVICE ARE VALID OR ENFORCEABLE UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ANY PARTICULAR STATE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL JURISDICTION. YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH LEGAL COUNSEL CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF ANY DOCUMENT YOU MAY SIGN ELECTRONICALLY USING GEMS’S ESIGNATURE SERVICE.
<br><br>
Entire Agreement
<br><br>
14.1 This Agreement encompasses the entire agreement between you and GEMS with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior representations, agreements and understandings, written or oral. This Agreement may only be altered, amended or modified by a written instrument executed by both parties. The failure of GEMS to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any part of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the Agreement shall be interpreted so as to reasonably effectuate the intention of the parties, and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. No purchase order or other form submitted by you will modify, supersede, add to or in any way vary the terms of this Agreement. As used herein, the words “including,” “included” and “includes” mean inclusion without limitation. You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without GEMS’s prior written consent. No part of this Agreement is intended or shall be construed as legal advice. GEMS shall not be liable for an errors or omissions in the content of this Agreement or for any actions taken in reliance thereon.

This Privacy Policy describes GEMS privacy practices in relation to the use of our website, apps and Services. It also describes the choices available to you with regard to the use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. The use of information collected through the GEMS shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Services for which the User or Client has engaged GEMS.
<br><br>


Privacy Promises
<br><br>
GEMS follows these principals in order to protect your privacy:
<br><br>
    We do not collect any more Personal Information than is necessary to provide the Services;

    We only use your Personal Information for the purposes we specify in this Privacy Policy, unless you agree otherwise;

    We do not keep your Personal Information if it is no longer needed; and

    Other than as we specify in this Privacy Policy, we do not share your Personal Information with third parties.
<br><br>
What Information Do We Collect?
<br><br>
When a User registers with GEMS, information is needed such as the User’s name, company name, business address, contact telephone number and email address. A billing address and credit card information is also required if the User has chosen a paid account. When a Visitor contacts us and/or requests information about GEMS, we will collect the Visitor’s email address and other contact information so that we may fulfil the Visitor’s request. Some information provided to us may, either alone or when connected with other information to which we may have access, individually identify a Visitor or User, and that information may be referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Personal Information.”
<br><br>
How Do We Use Your Information?
<br><br>
GEMS uses information, including Personal Information, provided by you to provide the Services and for business purposes such as processing and fulfilling orders, billing, service improvement, research, marketing, and for other general purposes. We may share information, other than Personal Information, with third parties for business and marketing purposes.
<br><br>
If you apply for a job with us, we will collect, process and store the information you provide to us for recruitment purposes. We may also retain some of your information for a reasonable period of time for purposes of considering you for future positions.
<br><br>
We will not share your Personal Information, or otherwise make your Personal Information available to any other parties except as provided in this Privacy Policy. We will not sell, rent, or exchange your Personal Information with any third-parties without permission from you.
<br><br>
We will share your information, including Personal Information, in order to respond to investigations, court orders, legal process, or to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of GEMS  Terms of Service , or as otherwise required by law. If we are required by law or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction to disclose your information, we will promptly notify you of this requirement so that you may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief.
<br><br>
We may also share your Personal Information with our trusted third party service providers, who help us to provide the Services. We will ensure that those service providers are obligated to protect your Personal Information under contract terms which are no less onerous than those set out in this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information may be transferred to the acquiring person or entity and you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information.
<br><br>
How Do We Protect Your Information?
<br><br>
All of your Personal Information remains private and confidential. The security of your Personal Information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
<br><br>
We follow generally accepted standards to protect Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, however, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

<br><br>
GEMS and its representatives will never request your account credentials. You should never share your GEMS account information with anyone else, including your username and password. We recommend that you use a unique password for your account that is not associated with other websites.

How We May Contact You.
